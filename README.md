# NixOS Configuration

This is a repository for storing NixOS configuration files and states. To use a particular host or NixOS version, modify the `configuration.nix` file to include for a different host, different user, or different NixOS version.

## TODO

1. Create extra users
2. Create per-user directories (or maybe repos?)
3. Add dotfiles pull/home-manager configuration
4. Find a decent music player
5. ...test things maybe
